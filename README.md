# Dosbox-X for Wolf

## Why?
I want to be able to run my MS-DOS, WIN 3.1 and WIN 98 SE discs inside Wolf, e.g., to directly jump into my desktop.
Also Dosbox-X is not available in Retroarch but provides much more functionality then the original Dosbox.

## Setup
1. clone the repository

2. build the image
docker build -t dosbox-image .

## Configuration
edit your wolf config.toml
