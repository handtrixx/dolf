# Dosbox-X for Wolf

## What is it?

This projects provides a dosbox-x desktop docker image to be used by the amazing Wolf aka Games-On-Whales project.

## Why?
I want to be able to run my MS-DOS, WIN 3.1 and WIN 98 SE discs inside Wolf, e.g., to directly jump into my desktop.
Also Dosbox-X is not available in Retroarch but provides much more functionality then the original Dosbox.

## Quickstart
1. clone the repository

2. build the image
docker build -t dosbox-image .

3. Config Wolf for DOS Games
edit your wolf config.toml

4. Config Wolf for Windows 3.11 (Games)

5. Config Wolf for Windows 98 SE (Games)
